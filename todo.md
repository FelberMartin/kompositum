# TODOs    
## 1.0 Release
### Next up
- Share button for ad screen
- Test easter eggs (orangensaft) sound

### Later
- Images on google play: remove debug label (just use gimp?)


# Bugs
- 


### Misc
- Hint idea: reshuffle components in pool / hidden components
- Feature idea: watch ad to double level finished rewards
- Spinning wheel after completion / noAttemptsLeft?
- Feature idea: Catalogues of collected words (for easy/medium/hard)
- Feature idea: instead of simple level progress, divide into sections. Each section could reward
  eg a trophy (emoji) 
  - Maybe spinning wheel for which trophy to get?
  - Or for collecting 100 words one can spin to get a trophy
- Gameplay idea: When starting a new level, a first modifier is already selected.
- English compounds?


## After 1.0 Release
- More game modes
  - See notion page
  - Redesign home page
- UI Improvements:
  - Indicate compound completion in the combination area (eg flash big textbuttons, or the plus sign)
  - Keep common UI components on screen, and only change children during navigation
    - BottomTabBar
    - AppBar
    - FlyStarAnimation
  - Animate component move in pool: maybe have to create Wrap widget as stack
- Tablet compatibility
- Advanced guide on first launch?
