# TODOs    
## 1.0 Release
### Next up

### Later
- Show combined words longer (or show history, or show longer if it took longer to find)
- LevelFinishedDialog: diamonds for used attempts confusing (remove diamonds for attempts, or
  write "2/3", 
- Images on google play: remove debug label (just use gimp?)


# Bugs
- B06
- B02 Sounds are not always played consistently


### Misc
- Hint idea: reshuffle components in pool / hidden components
- Feature idea: watch ad to double level finished rewards
- Spinning wheel after completion / noAttemptsLeft?
- Feature idea: Catalogues of collected words (for easy/medium/hard)
- Feature idea: instead of simple level progress, divide into sections. Each section could reward
  eg a trophy (emoji) 
  - Maybe spinning wheel for which trophy to get?
  - Or for collecting 100 words one can spin to get a trophy
- Level completion dialog title depending on performance
- Gameplay idea: When starting a new level, a first modifier is already selected.
- English compounds?

  - Animate component move in pool: maybe have to create Wrap widget as stack
