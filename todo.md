# TODOs    
## 1.0 Release
### Next up
- Create new aab, send changes for review

### Later
- LevelFinishedDialog: diamonds for used attempts confusing (remove diamonds for attempts, or
  write "2/3", 
- Store adjustments:
  - Images on google play: remove debug label (just use gimp?)
  - A/B testing with v0 app icon
  - Create ad video


# Bugs
- B15
- B09 App going to blackscreen after pressing "back to overview" button after completing daily from homescreen
  -> not reproducable 


### Misc
- Look for alternative frequency dataset (not from news)
- Hint idea: reshuffle components in pool / hidden components
- Feature idea: watch ad to double level finished rewards
- Spinning wheel after completion / noAttemptsLeft?
- Feature idea: Catalogues of collected words (for easy/medium/hard)
- Feature idea: instead of simple level progress, divide into sections. Each section could reward
  eg a trophy (emoji) 
  - Maybe spinning wheel for which trophy to get?
  - Or for collecting 100 words one can spin to get a trophy
- Level completion dialog title depending on performance
- English compounds?
